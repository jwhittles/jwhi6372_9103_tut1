# Part 1: Imaging Techniques and Inspiration
## Identify an imaging technique that you find inspiring for your assignment. This could be from an artwork, a design project, a film clip, or a movie.
An imaging technique which I find interesting and facinating is the use of opacity.

## Write a maximum of 100 words discussing which aspect of the example you'd like to incorporate into your project and why you believe it's a beneficial technique considering the assignment requirements.
Opacity gives the ability of depth within an artwork to be achieved. This can give the observer a deeper experience while observing an artwork. This would also give the ability for many singular pieces of artwork to be implemented into the one piece. With each piece having different levels of opacity, it can allow for layering to occur. Looking at other art works, many artists use this technique to create depth in their artworks and I believe achieving this in code will give the same effect.

## Include at least 2 high-quality screenshots or images to illustrate your chosen example.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
## Find a coding technique that could assist in implementing the imaging technique you selected in Part 1 of this quiz.
```
div {
  background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.3) /* Green background with 30% opacity */
}
```
## In no more than 100 words, discuss how this coding technique might help achieve or or contribute to the desired effect.
The code above simply creates a background with the rgb colour scheme with an opacity of 30%, meaning that the background is basically 30% white. This is a simple example of how this feature can work, but if this was used in a for loop with some user interaction an interactive artwork could be created where a hidden image can be uncovered or vice versa. Using the ‘random’ function in conjunction with opacity could also result in random features being uncovered in the artwork which could result in an interesting final piece.

## Provide an image or screenshot showcasing the coding technique in action, along with a link to an example implementation (including a link to some example code).
